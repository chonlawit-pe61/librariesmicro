 * Approximate division by 1000 without using integer division to avoid

 *
 * The algorithm is based on the binomial expansion of 1/(1-x):
 *
 * @code
 * 1/1000 = 1/(1024 - 24)
 *        = (1/2^10) * (1 / (1 - 3/2^7))
 *        = (1/2^10) * (1 + 3/2^7 + 9/2^14 + 27/2^21 + ...)
 *        = (1/2^10 + 3/2^17 + 9/2^24 + 27/2^31 + ...)
 * @endcode
 *
 * The truncation of this series means that this function returns
 * approximations which are always slightly smaller than the fully accurate
 * answer. See the unit tests for concrete examples. This approximation was
 * good enough for me in the situations where exact accuracy was not required.
 *
 * More accurate algorithms exist (see for example
 * http://www.hackersdelight.org/divcMore.pdf).
